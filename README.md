# Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Multivariate Regularized Polynomial Regression

In this repository, I implement a multivariate multiple linear regression model with polynomial features and regularization to predict fuel consumption efficiency. The model takes various vehicle characteristics as input and predicts fuel consumption for both city and highway driving (two output variables).

This project explores how predictive modeling can support governmental policies aimed at reducing COâ‚‚ emissions and optimizing infrastructure efficiency. By collecting vehicle efficiency statistics, such a system could help consumers make informed purchasing decisions and enable authorities to incentivize fuel-efficient choices.

For example, if a newly purchased vehicle ranks in the top 10% for fuel efficiency compared to previously registered vehicles in its expected driving environment (city vs. highway), the buyer could receive a significant tax reduction. Assuming a future where driving history and fuel consumption are recorded for sustainability purposes, this approach could encourage environmentally friendly vehicle choices, ultimately leading to lower emissions and improved transportation infrastructure planning.
